# Covid Exploration and Visualization

This is a SQL data exploration of Covid death and Covid vaccination data lead by Alex the Analyst on Youtube.
The data acquired was from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths .
Unfortunately the covid vaccination table is too big to have on my github folder for this project.
Through this eploration I was able to use multiple queries to show diffrent data comparisons from both the covid death and covid vaccination tables .
Because the time difference of Alex's initial exploration to now, some modifications needed to be implemented for some quearies at the end as they exceeded the size possible for my version of Microsoft SQL Server.

This visualization was created using 4 of the Covid Exploration queries, and guided by Alex the Analyst as well. Through the 4 tables added into Tablaeu I was able to produce 5 Visuals showing total deaths, death by continent, death by income, percentage of infection by country, and percentage of infection by continent. Due to the increased amount of data I was able to add the death by income visual that was not availiable in the original project.
