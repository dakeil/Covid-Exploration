# Covid-Exploration

This is a SQL data exploration of Covid death and Covid vaccination data lead by Alex the Analyst on Youtube.
The data acquired was from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
Unfortunately the covid vaccination table is too big to have on my github folder for this project
Through this eploration I was able to use multiple queries to show diffrent data comparisons from both the covid death and covid vaccination tables 
Because the time difference of Alex's initial exploration to now, some modifications needed to be implemented for some quearies at the end as they exceeded the size possible for my version of Microsoft SQL Server.
